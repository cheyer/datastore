# datastore
-version 0.1.0-
This is a simple key value store consisting of
-DB.java
-FileIO.java
-Console.java

You can set, get and delete values, the database reads the key-value-pairs from a file during startup when available.
When closing the database saves the key-value-pairs to a file.
Right now, there is just a Console interface.

Functionalities for later versions:
-REST API
-more nodes
-sharding
